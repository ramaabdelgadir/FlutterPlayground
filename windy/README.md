# 🍁 Windy – Weather App

A clean and minimal **Flutter weather app** built for practice and real-time forecasting.

Users can:

- 📍 Automatically detect their current city  
- 🌡️ View current temperature and weather conditions  
- 💧 See humidity, pressure, wind speed, and cloud coverage  
- 📅 Browse a 7-day forecast with daily summaries  

All data is fetched from the **OpenWeatherMap API**, using the device’s location via **Geolocator** and **Geocoding**.
